We led the development of an interactive spatial planning App to support real-time stakeholder engagement across 27 CCAMLR member states in the Weddell Sea (1.57 million km²). The process informed a proposal—tabled by Norway—to protect 628,000 km² (40%) as a marine protected area. Though not yet adopted due to geopolitical challenges, hopefully it will be in the future when international relationships stabilise. However, the transparent, participatory planning tool we developed continues to shape the design of protected areas.

During this process we worked closely with our partners - [The Norwegian Polar Institute](https://npolar.no/en/) - to tailor the app to their needs. The App used data from [The WSMPA Phase 2 Atlas](https://tryggve.npolar.no/web/maudatlas/Atlas.html) that was the result of an international collaborative effort. During the process we led virtual stakeholder workshops (during COVID) to guide scientists and policy makers through the App to better understand the spatial planning process.

This was the original! The work we undertook on this initial App for the Weddell Sea kickstarted the development of our highly customisable and relocatable [**_shinyplanr_**](realTime/shinyplanr.html) app that is deployed today in regions such as [Kosrae](realTime/Kosrae/html).

## CBCS Presentation 

In August 2023, Dr Jason Everett discussed stakeholder engagement using the Weddell Sea Phase 2 app to the Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science at The University of Queensland.
