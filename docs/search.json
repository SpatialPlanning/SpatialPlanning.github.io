Instead, they explore plans independently, reducing the need for multiple expert-led workshops.\nClear trade-offs: See exactly how different features, zones, and costs shape a plan. Understand where the compromises are — and who is affected.\nInsights that matter: The shinyplanr app highlights which features drive solutions. Often, only a few constraints determine the outcome — and this becomes clear through direct exploration.\nFlexible objectives: Unlike tools with one fixed goal, shinyplanr supports multiple planning questions. Want to see what 30% protection gets you? You can.\nRich functionality: Built in R with prioritizr, shinyplanr offers all the power of Marxan — and then some.\nScalable and customisable: From tiny areas such as Kosrae in Federated States of Micronesia, to vast regions such as the Weddell Sea, shinyplanr adapts to your geography, language, and data."

We are ready to partner with you. Please contact Anthony, Daniel or Jason to discuss future partnerships.\n\nFuture work: Climate-smart app to empower marine planning in a changing world\n\nClimate change is rapidly undermining the effectiveness of traditional marine protected areas by shifting species distributions, disrupting ecosystems, and transforming ocean conditions. Despite this, most marine spatial planning (MSP) efforts still overlook climate change or treat it as an afterthought, risking misaligned conservation efforts and leaving marine ecosystems and dependent communities vulnerable. There is an urgent need to integrate climate foresight into planning frameworks to avoid wasting resources and to ensure biodiversity protection in the face of environmental change.\nTo address this gap, we envisage a suite of interactive, real-time web tools to embed climate change into the heart of MSP. The first phase would involve a regional climate app that lets users explore future ocean conditions under different emissions scenarios, visualise changes across key climate variables, and identify climate refugia and hotspots. Building on this, the second phase would deliver a biodiversity-climate risk app that applies a cutting-edge climate vulnerability index to assess species and habitat risk, guiding the design of climate-smart MPAs.\nThese open-source tools would empower planners—particularly in data-limited and island regions—to make informed, forward-looking decisions, helping countries meet biodiversity and climate targets while ensuring more resilient ocean stewardship.\nWe are looking for partners to realise this vision."

This creates growing tension between conservation objectives and economic development, particularly in coastal and marine regions where multiple industries—such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, and renewable energy—converge. Multiple-use spatial planning offers a promising pathway to balance these competing needs, but there remains a lack of practical guidance on how to implement it effectively. Key challenges include integrating diverse sectoral priorities, anticipating the economic impacts of spatial decisions, and ensuring planning tools are both scientifically robust and accessible to practitioners with varying levels of technical capacity.\nTo address this gap, we are developing a zoning approach within the shinyplanr application that explicitly supports multiple-use planning. By incorporating zones—such as those used in urban zoning schemes—into marine and terrestrial planning scenarios, users will be able to explore and visualize trade-offs and co-benefits across sectors in a transparent and data-driven way. This is especially critical in densely used inshore areas where spatial conflicts are most acute. Building on the prioritizr framework already used in Waitt Institute planning, we are working to expand functionality in shinyplanr and improve computational performance for more efficient scenario testing. These enhancements will make multiple-use spatial planning more accessible, scalable, and practical for real-world decision-making."

    "text": "Ecosystem services\n Conventional spatial planning approaches often prioritise minimising conflict with extractive industries, typically by excluding economically valuable areas such as heavily fished zones from conservation. While this reduces resistance from stakeholders, it limits the ecological effectiveness and long-term benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs). A growing body of research, including that of Dabala et al. (2023), highlights the missed opportunities in not accounting for the multiple ecosystem services provided by key coastal habitats. These services include carbon sequestration by seagrasses and mangroves, coastal protection offered by coral reefs, and critical nursery habitats for commercially important fish species. Despite their importance, these benefits are rarely quantified or directly integrated into spatial planning decisions, representing a major scientific and practical gap.\nTo address this, we are identifying key ecosystem services from the most common coastal habitats in planning regions—namely coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds. Our approach focuses on explicitly incorporating these ecosystem service data into conservation prioritisation, allowing for more holistic spatial planning outcomes for coastal communities. We aim to highlight the value proposition of conservation, beyond biodiversity gains and highlighting the critical and tangible socio-economic benefits. This work will not only support more resilient protected areas but also enhance stakeholder buy-in and implementation success by linking conservation with ecosystem service provision that directly benefits coastal communities."

    "text": "Climate-smart\n Climate change is compromising the effectiveness of established protected areas by transforming communities, driving local extinctions, and causing species to shift beyond the boundaries of protected areas.\n\nThe Challenge: Protected today, unprotected tomorrow\nThese climate-driven changes threaten to erode decades of conservation investment. Yet, climate change remains largely absent from most marine spatial planning (MSP) initiatives, where it is often treated as a secondary concern—when considered at all.This omission poses a serious risk: without integrating climate information into conservation decisions, we risk misallocating resources, misjudging future biodiversity patterns, and leaving marine ecosystems — and the communities that depend on them — increasingly vulnerable.\n\n\nOur Solution: Climate-smart protected areas\nWe have developed multiple approaches for designing climate-smart protected areas. These preferentially place protected areas in climate refugia or climate adaptation hotspots (see Publications – Buenafe et al. (2025); Buenafe et al. (2023); Brito-Morales et al. (2022); Arafeh Dalmau et al. (2021)). Our methods are based on global Earth System Models and are thus ideal for data-poor regions, and in small regions we use data from high resolution climate models (10 km). These methods can be included in our shinyplanr real-time spatial planning app."
