Also, you will need to have install permissions on your laptop, otherwise get your IT support to help.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nGo to the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) R website. If you type ‘r’ into Google it is the first entry, then choose CRAN under Download, Packages on the left hand side, and then choose a mirror site in Australia.\n\nChoose to download R for Linux, Mac or Windows.\n\nFor Windows users, just install ‘base’ and this will link you to the download file.\n\nFor Mac users, choose the version relevant to your Operating System.\n\nIf you are a Linux user, you know what to do!\n\n## 3. Installing RStudio\nWe will use RStudio in this Workshop, a free front-end to R for Windows, Mac or Linux (i.e., R is working in the background). It makes working with R easier, more productive, and organised, especially for new users. There are other front-ends, but RStudio is the most popular. Please make sure you have the latest version (currently 2023.12).\nGo to the RStudio website and choose Install RStudio. It should autodetect your machine type, but if it doesn’t, you can choose the download for the machine type you have down the bottom of the page."

    "text": "As global demands for food, energy, and infrastructure continue to rise, competition for limited land and ocean space is intensifying. This creates growing tension between conservation objectives and economic development, particularly in coastal and marine regions where multiple industries—such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, and renewable energy—converge. Multiple-use spatial planning offers a promising pathway to balance these competing needs, but there remains a lack of practical guidance on how to implement it effectively. Key challenges include integrating diverse sectoral priorities, anticipating the economic impacts of spatial decisions, and ensuring planning tools are both scientifically robust and accessible to practitioners with varying levels of technical capacity.\nTo address this gap, we are developing a zoning approach within the shinyplanr application that explicitly supports multiple-use planning. By incorporating zones—such as those used in urban zoning schemes—into marine and terrestrial planning scenarios, users will be able to explore and visualize trade-offs and co-benefits across sectors in a transparent and data-driven way. This is especially critical in densely used inshore areas where spatial conflicts are most acute. Building on the prioritizr framework already used in Waitt Institute planning, we are working to expand functionality in shinyplanr and improve computational performance for more efficient scenario testing. These enhancements will make multiple-use spatial planning more accessible, scalable, and practical for real-world decision-making."

These climate-driven changes threaten to erode decades of conservation investment. Yet, climate change remains largely absent from most marine spatial planning (MSP) initiatives, where it is often treated as a secondary concern—when considered at all.\nThis omission poses a serious risk: without integrating climate information into conservation decisions, we risk misallocating resources, misjudging future biodiversity patterns, and leaving marine ecosystems — and the communities that depend on them — increasingly vulnerable.\n\n\nOur Solution: Climate-smart protected areas\nWe have developed multiple approaches for designing climate-smart protected areas. These preferentially place protected areas in climate refugia or climate adaptation hotspots (see Publications – Buenafe et al. (2025); Buenafe et al. (2023); Brito-Morales et al. (2022); Arafeh Dalmau et al. (2021)). Our methods are based on global Earth System Models and are thus ideal for data-poor regions, and in small regions we use data from high resolution climate models (10 km). These methods can be included in our shinyplanr real-time spatial planning app."

    "text": "What makes shinyplanr different?\nReal-time planning: Most scenarios run in seconds, allowing stakeholders to quickly test options and iterate without delays.\nTransparent, user-driven decisions: Users control targets, costs, and constraints — that means more learning, more trust, and faster buy-in.\nFaster consensus, fewer workshops: Stakeholders do not need to agree upfront. Instead, they explore plans independently, reducing the need for multiple expert-led workshops.\nClear trade-offs: See exactly how different features, zones, and costs shape a plan. Understand where the compromises are — and who is affected.\nInsights that matter: The shinyplanr app highlights which features drive solutions. Often, only a few constraints determine the outcome — and this becomes clear through direct exploration.\nFlexible objectives: Unlike tools with one fixed goal, shinyplanr supports multiple planning questions. Want to see what 30% protection gets you? You can.\nRich functionality: Built in R with prioritizr, shinyplanr offers all the power of Marxan — and then some.\nScalable and customisable: From tiny areas such as Kosrae in Federated States of Micronesia, to vast regions such as the Weddell Sea, shinyplanr adapts to your geography, language, and data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As global demands for food, energy, and infrastructure continue to rise, competition for limited land and ocean space is intensifying. This creates growing tension between conservation objectives and economic development, particularly in coastal and marine regions where multiple industries—such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, and renewable energy—converge. Multiple-use spatial planning offers a promising pathway to balance these competing needs, but there remains a lack of practical guidance on how to implement it effectively. Key challenges include integrating diverse sectoral priorities, anticipating the economic impacts of spatial decisions, and ensuring planning tools are both scientifically robust and accessible to practitioners with varying levels of technical capacity.\nTo address this gap, we are developing a zoning approach within the shinyplanr application that explicitly supports multiple-use planning. By incorporating zones—such as those used in urban zoning schemes—into marine and terrestrial planning scenarios, users will be able to explore and visualize trade-offs and co-benefits across sectors in a transparent and data-driven way. This is especially critical in densely used inshore areas where spatial conflicts are most acute. Building on the prioritizr framework already used in Waitt Institute planning, we are working to expand functionality in shinyplanr and improve computational performance for more efficient scenario testing. These enhancements will make multiple-use spatial planning more accessible, scalable, and practical for real-world decision-making."

    "section": "Ecosystem services",
    "text": "Ecosystem services\nConventional spatial planning approaches often prioritise minimising conflict with extractive industries, typically by excluding economically valuable areas such as heavily fished zones from conservation. While this reduces resistance from stakeholders, it limits the ecological effectiveness and long-term benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs). A growing body of research, including that of Dabala et al. (2023), highlights the missed opportunities in not accounting for the multiple ecosystem services provided by key coastal habitats. These services include carbon sequestration by seagrasses and mangroves, coastal protection offered by coral reefs, and critical nursery habitats for commercially important fish species. Despite their importance, these benefits are rarely quantified or directly integrated into spatial planning decisions, representing a major scientific and practical gap.\nTo address this, we are identifying key ecosystem services from the most common coastal habitats in planning regions—namely coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds. Our approach focuses on explicitly incorporating these ecosystem service data into conservation prioritisation, allowing for more holistic spatial planning outcomes for coastal communities. We aim to highlight the value proposition of conservation, beyond biodiversity gains and highlighting the critical and tangible socio-economic benefits. This work will not only support more resilient protected areas but also enhance stakeholder buy-in and implementation success by linking conservation with ecosystem service provision that directly benefits coastal communities."
