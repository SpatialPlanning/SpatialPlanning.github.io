We will have a 15 minute Morning/Afternoon Tea break and Lunch will be from 12:30-1:30 pm. -->

<!-- There are lots of places to [eat on campus](https://maps.uq.edu.au/?zoom=17.490780813923735&campusId=406&lat=-27.496416376945803&lng=153.01218778256037&zLevel=1&category=31754){target="_blank"}. -->

<!-- **PLEASE READ CAREFULLY** In order to take full advantage of the workshop, you will need to have a laptop, have the ability to connect to a public wifi network (details below), have the latest versions of R and RStudio installed on your machine, have successfully installed all the required packages (see below). If you are using a work/company laptop where access is restricted, please double check these conditions with your IT department. -->

<!-- Please come back here regularly before the workshop. If there are any changes we will put them here and highlight them. -->

<!-- ## 1. Laptops -->

<!-- Bring a laptop, if at all possible. Otherwise, you will need to work in pairs (which is fun too!). You will need to have install permissions on your laptop to install the software and packages below. If you don't, ask get your IT support to help. -->

<!-- ## 2. Installing R -->

<!-- It is straightforward to install R on your machine. **Please make sure you have the latest version (currently R 4.4.2)**. If you already have R installed, you can check you have the version R version "4.4.2 (2024-10-31)" by running `version` in the console. If you don't have version 4.4.2 , please update. -->

<!-- ### Follow these steps: -->

<!-- 1.  Go to the [CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) R website](http://cran.r-project.org){target="_blank"}. If you type 'r' into Google it is the first entry, then choose CRAN under Download, Packages on the left hand side, and then choose a mirror site in Australia.\ -->
<!-- 2.  Choose to download R for Linux, Mac or Windows.\ -->
<!-- 3.  For Windows users, just install 'base' and this will link you to the download file.\ -->
<!-- 4.  For Mac users, choose the version relevant to your Operating System.\ -->
<!-- 5.  If you are a Linux user, you know what to do! -->

<!-- ## 3. Installing RStudio -->

<!-- We will use RStudio in this Workshop, a free front-end to R for Windows, Mac or Linux (i.e., R is working in the background). It makes working with R easier, more productive, and organised, especially for new users. There are other front-ends, but RStudio is the most popular. **Please make sure you have the latest version (currently Version: 2024.12.0)**. You can check your version by going to the menu "Help" --\> "Check for Updates". -->

<!-- Go to the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} and choose Install RStudio. It should autodetect your machine type, but if it doesn't, you can choose the download for the machine type you have down the bottom of the page. -->

<!-- ## 4. Installing the packages needed for the Workshop -->

<!-- Depending on what day you attend, there will be different package requirements. Please carefully read the instructions below and run the code corresponding to the day(s) of the workshop you are attending. -->

You can ensure everything is up to date by running the following code. -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- update.packages(ask = FALSE) -->
