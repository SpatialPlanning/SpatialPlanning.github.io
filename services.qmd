![We work closely with our partners](images/Collaboration.jpeg){.float-right .lightbox width=40%}
We design practical, science-based spatial plans that balance conservation, sustainable use, and climate resilience. Our team brings deep expertise in integrating biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human uses, while avoiding residual protection and supporting genuine stakeholder engagement.

We work with partners to:

* Define planning needs

* Process biodiversity and ecosystem service data

*	Deploy customised, transparent [**_shinyplanr_**](realTime/shinyplanr.html) apps for real-time use

*	Facilitate inclusive stakeholder workshops

*	Develop and evaluate candidate spatial plans

Our solutions incorporate:

*	Multiple-use planning that balances ecological and economic priorities

*	Climate-smart approaches that future-proof conservation under climate change

*	Ecosystem service mapping for carbon, coastal protection, and fisheries

These elements underpin our collaborative approach to delivering effective, equitable ocean planning. We are ready to partner with you.
