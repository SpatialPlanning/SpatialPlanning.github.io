## Real-time planning with _shinyplanr_

<img src="images/shinyplanr.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 200px">

The **_shinyplanr_** app is a fast, flexible, and transparent web tool that helps countries deliver smarter spatial plans — for biodiversity, climate and people. It puts planning power directly into stakeholders’ hands, letting them test scenarios, explore trade-offs, and make decisions in real time.

Built on robust science and the proven R language and _prioritizr_ engine, **_shinyplanr_** helps overcome the delays and disconnects of traditional MSP. It’s user-friendly, fully customisable, and designed for all stakeholders — no prior spatial planning experience is needed.

## What makes _shinyplanr_ different?

**Real-time planning**: Most scenarios run in seconds, allowing stakeholders to quickly test options and iterate without delays.

**Transparent, user-driven decisions**: Users control targets, costs, and constraints — that means more learning, more trust, and faster buy-in.

**Faster consensus, fewer workshops**: Stakeholders do not need to agree upfront. Instead, they explore plans independently, reducing the need for multiple expert-led workshops.

**Clear trade-offs**: See exactly how different features, zones, and costs shape a plan. Understand where the compromises are — and who is affected.

**Insights that matter**: The **_shinyplanr_** app highlights which features drive solutions. Often, only a few constraints determine the outcome — and this becomes clear through direct exploration.

**Flexible objectives**: Unlike tools with one fixed goal, shinyplanr supports multiple planning questions. Want to see what 30% protection gets you? You can.

**Rich functionality**: Built in R with prioritizr, **_shinyplanr_** offers all the power of Marxan — and then some.

**Scalable and customisable**: From tiny areas such as [Kosrae](whereWeWork/Kosrae.html) in Federated States of Micronesia, to vast regions such as the [Weddell Sea](whereWeWork/WeddellSea.html), shinyplanr adapts to your geography, language, and data.
