Accelerating human activities and intensifying climate change and are threatening biodiversity. In response, countries are scaling-up spatial planning to meet targets under the [Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.cbd.int/gbf) — expanding spatial planning ([Target 1](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/1)), restoring ecosystems ([Target 2](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/2)), and conserving biodiversity ([Target 3](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/3)). But planning is complex. Each nation has unique requirements, and stakeholder processes are often slow and gridlocked, hindered by a disconnect between planning tools and stakeholder needs.

## Our mission

We are a team of university researchers advancing spatial planning for real-world conservation. Our mission is to support biodiversity outcomes through transparent, cutting-edge research-driven tools tailored to local contexts. 

We co-design planning solutions, with our partners, that support biodiversity conservation, restoration, and sustainable ocean use under a changing climate. We have expertise in developing rapid, effective and inclusive spatial plans and are continually improving our open-source platform [**_shinyplanr_**](realTime/shinyplanr.html) based on user feedback and emerging science.

[Prof. Anthony J. Richardson](https://mathmarecol.github.io/people/#professor-anthony-j.-richardson) – A mathematical ecologist with 25+ years of research experience in climate change ecology, ecosystem modelling, and conservation science. He has authored over 250 scientific papers, been cited more than 35,000 times, and has made significant contributions to our understanding of climate impacts on marine ecosystems—from plankton to fish. His research has also helped shape national and international strategies for marine spatial planning, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem-based management.

[Dr Jason Everett](https://jaseeverett.github.io) – A spatial ecologist and data scientist developing tools for designing protected areas and analysing climate change impacts on ecosystems. He has spent 15+ years working on understanding how oceanographic processes structure global pelagic food webs, designing climate-smart marine protected areas and investigating the impact of climate-change on marine ecosystem function. He leads the development of R-packages and Shiny visualisation tools that are used to inform marine management.

:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
Sandra is a marine data scientist with an interest in marine spatial planning, particularly multiple use, and ecosystem modelling. She holds a BSc (Hons) in Marine Biology from the University of Plymouth and a MSc in Bioinformatics from the University of Leipzig. Sandra previous experience includes writing R packages and Shiny apps to facilitate stakeholder engagement with time-efficient and reproducible marine spatial planning apps. Her research focuses on designing marine protected areas and assessing their costs and benefits from an ecological and economic perspective. Her PhD will address multiple-use spatial planning in the Global South in a joint project by the University of Queensland and the University of Exeter.

Kristine, better known as Tin, is a quantitative marine ecologist from the Philippines. Tin has a Master’s degree in [Tropical Biodiversity and Ecosystems (TROPIMUNDO)](https://tropimundo.eu), an Eramus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree program, where she finished first in her batch (Plus Grande Distinction). Tin has developed methods used by conservation practitioners to transition to more climate-smart spatial planning approaches. She’s done this by prioritising protection on climate refugia. In her PhD research, Tin wishes to continue her work on climate change and spatial planning by taking it a step further and developing ways of designing more connected, climate-smart protected area networks.

Alvise is a PhD student at the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab and the Applied Marine Biogeography Lab, supervised by Prof. Anthony Richardson and A/Prof. Daniel Dunn. His research focuses on developing climate-smart and connected spatial prioritisations for mangrove conservation to protect mangrove biodiversity and ecosystem services. He holds an Erasmus Mundus Master’s degree in tropical ecology (TROPIMUNDO). During his thesis, he developed a global study which identifies priority areas for mangrove conservation that maximise ecosystem services. Before starting his PhD at The University of Queensland, he joined the iAtlantic project, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, developing spatial prioritisations for the conservation of the Atlantic Ocean at the University of Azores.

Kris is a research assistant with the team. He has recently finished an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Tropical Biodiversity and Ecosystems (TROPIMUNDO), where he graduated as the top student of his cohort and received the Best Student Award. For his masters, he has studied in different institutions across different countries in Europe: Université Libre de Bruxelles/Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Semester 1); Université de La Réunion (Semester 2); and Università degli Studi di Firenze (Semester 3). For his final semester, which is completely allocated to thesis work, he worked on a marine spatial planning project using quantitative tools with The University of Queensland.
